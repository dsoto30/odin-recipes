    <h2>Dish Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mozzarella sticks are a popular appetizer made from sticks of mozzarella cheese that are coated in a 
        breadcrumb mixture and deep-fried until golden and crispy on the outside, while the cheese inside 
        becomes melted and gooey. They are typically served hot, often accompanied by a marinara sauce or 
        other dipping sauce. Mozzarella sticks are a savory, crunchy, and cheesy snack that are enjoyed by 
        many people as a party food or a quick bite. They can be found in many restaurants, bars, and fast-food 
        chains around the world.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. 
            Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. 
            Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
        <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. 
            Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. 
            Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. 
            Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. 
            Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. 
            Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.
        </li>
